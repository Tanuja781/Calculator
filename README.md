# Calculator
A calculator designed using HTML is a simple web-based application that performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The main purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use and interactive tool for performing calculations through a browser interface. By using HTML for structure, along with CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality, the calculator offers a clear layout and responsive design.

This type of calculator helps users quickly compute values without installing any software, making it accessible on different devices. It also serves as a beginner-friendly project to understand user input handling, event-driven programming, and the integration of front-end web technologies.
